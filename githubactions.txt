--------        Practice CI/CD with Github Actions   ( react javascript framework  )        --------

->  You Know what to do .github/workflow
->  CODEOWNER
->  Commands to React App 

"scripts": {
    "start": "react-scripts start", -> Development Mode
    "build": "react-scripts build", -> Generate Folder for Prod
    "test": "react-scripts test",   -> Run the tests
    "eject": "react-scripts eject"  -> I dont know what this do!!!
},

we deploy this app static using surge ``` npm install --global surge [ https://surge.sh/  ] ```
1. npm run build -> To generate the Build Folder to deploy using surge 
2.  Run serge command and config
*   quaint-fish.surge.sh -> Surge Domain


-> Using Prettier what code rules we and our team need to write the same shape
1. Prettier [ https://prettier.io/ ] 
2. install Prettier [ npm install --save-dev --save-exact prettier ]
* Prettier PlayGround [ You need to decide what is the correctly form to continues write the entire project ]
3. create a file -> .prettierrc -> and paste a JSON generate in prettier PlayGround

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

-> Discuss about our project Depend the team member
-> The head Branches in our projects are [ main, master, develop ]
*   -> Other branches in our team can be : feature01, feature02, feature03 -> Run Workflow and Pull request to merge with Develop -> Then
    develop -> Run Workflow -> Then merge to Master -> Run Workflow -> Then To Producction 

1. Create a Branches [ Develop & Features what you need ]
2. Create a branch rules protection
    * Require pull request review before mergin
    * dismmos stale pull request aprovals 
    * require review from Code Owner 
    * Require status checks to pass before merging 
    * include admins
